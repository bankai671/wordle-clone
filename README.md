# Wordle Game Clone

New York Times Wordle application clone on React and Typescript

## Description

This project is a clone of the popular word-guessing game "Wordle." The game presents the player with a mystery five-letter word, and the player must make a series of guesses to determine the word within six attempts. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating which letters are correct and in the right position and which letters are present but in the wrong position.

The project is implemented using React with TypeScript and styled with LESS for easier maintenance and better organization.
